# knowledge-graph-learning
Use of GNN architectures for prediction tasks on knowledge graphs.

We used a two layer R-GCN to obtain knowledge graph node embeddings, then DistMult as decoder for link prediction task. Nodes have Local Degree Profile (LDP) and one-hot encoded types as features. 

We tested hetero graph learning models.
